# Tic-Tac-Toe AIs

This is a collection of Tic-Tac-Toe AIs that I have created.  There are four main ones:

- A minimax algorithm that plays Tic-Tac-Toe perfectly
- A neural network written from scratch using just numpy and scipy that trains on data extracted from the minimax algorithm (very slow)
- A neural network written in Tensorflow that trains on data extracted from the minimax algorithm (faster)
- A Q-learning algorithm that trains by playing against itself (WIP)
