# Tic-Tac-Toe AIs

This is a collection of Tic-Tac-Toe AIs that I have created.  There are three main ones:

- A minimax algorithm that plays Tic-Tac-Toe perfectly
- A Neural Network that trains on data generated using the minimax algorithm
- A Q-learning algorithm that trains by playing against itself.
